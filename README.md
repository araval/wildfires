y-axis for area is in "number of San Francisco[e]s". So the largest fire in 2020 has burned and area equal to about 29 times the area of San Francisco.
  
### Monthly Stats
"month" is the month fire started. This plot is in direct conflict with what is reported as "fire season", i.e. months of October and November. Most fires seem to start in July and August.
